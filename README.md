# Markov-Chain-Name-Generator
For Coyote and Crow LLC I was tasked with creating a name generator. After some research I decided that natural language generation using a Markov Chain algorithm was the best path. I used this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGFJ8vugIWA and modified it slightly to get the desired output then integrated it into the Coyote and Crow Wordpress site.  https://coyoteandcrow.net/chahi-name/
